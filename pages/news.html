          n 1989, at the CERN laboratory in Europe (French: Conseil Européen
          pour la Recherche Nucléaire, CERN), Sir Timothy John «Tim» Berners Lee
          developed the concept of the World Wide Web (WWW). If before that,
          information could only be sent to a specific recipient by e-mail, Tim
          Berners Lee wanted to make the distribution of information even
          easier. His idea, at first glance, was simple and, from today’s point
          of view, completely natural. An e-mail is a kind of computer file that
          contains certain digital information. After all, this file,
          information, can not be sent to a specific recipient, but can be
          placed on the Internet and viewed by interested parties there. A
          website is a computer file that is located on one of the Internet
          servers and can be opened by anyone who wants to. Developers use
          several software tools to build a website, the most common of which
          are: 1. Hypertext Marku

          People who create the appearance of a website are called web
          developers. They are also often called Front End Developers, which
          emphasizes that they create the Front of the website, that is, the
          part with which the user interacts. It may sound strange to some, but
          building a website is a creative process, since a web developer always
          has to create a new, different website. Web development is usually a
          team activity and consists of several stages. Web designers create the
          design of the website. Then, web developers, according to the approved
          design, build the website. Back-End developers may also be involved in
          this process. When the website is ready, testers get involved. They
          check how well the site works through the testing process.

          There is a perception that only people with technical education can
          learn to build a website. However, as time goes by, we see the
          opposite picture. More and more people from different professions are
          learning programming, creating applications of varying complexity and
          building websites themselves. The development of technologies has made
          it possible for people from different professions to realize their own
          ideas. If earlier, finances were needed to realize an innovative idea,
          today a person can master the technical knowledge necessary to realize
          the idea himself, for example, study website building and create his
          own company website, build an online store or any other virtual online
          service.
